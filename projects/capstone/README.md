# Capstone Project Proposal

## Datasets

* The dataset used for this project is the one provided by Kaggle at their competition page [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/data).

* Additional weather data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mathijs/weather-data-in-new-york-city-2016)

* The equation used for calculating RMSLE can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration#evaluation).

##  Programming language and libraries used
* Python 3.5
* pandas, numpy - For data manipulation
* matplotlib - For data visualisation
* geopy - For calculating distances using lat/long values
* scikit-learn - Open source machine learning library
* xgboost - Gradient Boosting package for python
* keras - Deep learning Library

## Instructions

1. First download the datasets linked above.
2. Run the FeatureExtraction notebook which creates the training and test datasets that the models use.
3. Any of the notebooks with the different models can now be run.
