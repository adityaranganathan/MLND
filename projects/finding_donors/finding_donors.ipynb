    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf).

One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature.

    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",

    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "**Answer: **  \n",
    "- **Guassian Naive Bayes**\n",
    " - GuassianNB is a popular model for spam classification. In general it is used for text categorization. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier#Document_classification)\n",
    " - Performs well when features are independant from each other. Has good classification performance although the model is bad at estimating probabilities. Performs well even with small datasets. Works well with datasets having large number of features.\n",
    " - Makes a strong assumption that the features contribute to the probability of the output class independantly. So performs poorly when features are dependant on each other. Bad at propbabilty estimation. Bad at predicting continuous values.\n",
    " - The features of this dataset seem to be independant. So GuassianNB could give accurate predictions.\n",
    "- **RandomForestClassifier**\n",
    " - RandomForest Classifiers are used in a wide range of classification and regression applications.In this example it was used to assess the credit risk of customers. (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nazeeh_Ghatasheh/publication/268215588_Business_Analytics_using_Random_Forest_Trees_for_Credit_Risk_Prediction_A_Comparison_Study/links/546f292e0cf2d67fc0305645/Business-Analytics-using-Random-Forest-Trees-for-Credit-Risk-Prediction-A-Comparison-Study.pdf)\n",
    " - The RandomForest model significantly reduces overfitting when compared to a single decision tree since the predictions are made using several decision trees trained on subsets of the data. Can be used to rank the features according to importance. Works well with categorical features.\n",
    " - The model cannot predict beyond the values that it is shown. It is more complex than a single decision tree and does not provide much insight into the data.\n",
    " - Random Forests generally have good performance on classification tasks and reduce the overfitting problem of the base learner. This model could also have been used with the raw features version of the data since it handles categorical features well.\n",
    "- **Support Vector Machines**\n",
    " - SVM's can be used for regression and classification tasks. In this example it is used to model financial time series data for forecasting purposes. (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305048301000263?via%3Dihub)\n",
    " - Works well with data that is not lineraly seperable. SVM's are robust due to the margin being maximised. The kernel trick is useful for classification.\n",
    " - SVM's can have high memory requirements depending on the kernel used. Training and testing time can be longer than other models. Hyperparameter tuning and choosing a kernel can be challenging.\n",
    " - SVM's have good classification performance and can handle high dimensional data well so it could perform well in our dataset."

The ideal condition to split the data is found by the algorithm by checking how much information is gained by splitting using that condition. This process is continued till every leaf in the tree has the same class (>50K or less than 50K). The final classifier contains a large number of these decision trees. Each seperate decision tree is trained on a random subset of the data so that we dont have many identical trees which would not be useful. Further at each node of the tree there is some randomness added regarding which feature the tree will use to split on. This makes sure all the trees dont use similar features to split on the data. So in the end we have many trees that are different from each other and so will not make the same prediction. When a new testing point is given to the trained model all the individual decision trees predict the output of that test point. The final output of the model is decided by a majority vote by all the trees. This makes sure the most likely ouput is predicted."

    "**Answer:** The model trained on the reduced data performs worse than the one trained on the full data. The accuracy reduced from 0.8615 to 0.8478 an the F-score reduced from 0.7316 to 0.6988. This is a significant reduction in performance. I would not consider using the reduced data set since even with the full dataset the RandomForestClassifier has a relativly short training and testing time."
